## Introduction

### Summary
Our project is to create a connected system of storm drain sensors that will detect changes in water level in order to provide real time flood updates at a more granular level.  In addition to the water level changes we will also include temperature and humidity sensors to provide more context for the water level rise and potentially increase fidelity of the readings

### Motivation
As flooding becomes a larger problem due to climate change areas that are not usually flooded are now becoming susceptible to flash flooding.  Currently notification systems work at a high level and are not in real time.  With these sensors we can quickly and accurately provide real time information for flood risks at a granular level.
## Goals
What are you going to achieve by the end of the project specifically?
For Progress Report
## Current Progress
Summarize what you have done so far
### Highlights: In particular, articulate thing(s) you have learned / solved outside of what was taught in class
### Problems Encountered
Articulate the problems you have encountered
This section is of the most importance in the progress report. It not only give the TA information on what help you may need, and also encourages you to think deeper about your problems.
## Future Plan
Describe what you plan to do in the next two weeks
## Methodology
### Phenomena of Interest
Describe the physical phenomena of interest, e.g. physical principles, static and dynamic behavior, and signal characteristics
### Sensor(s) Used
Describe the sensor(s) you used, e.g. physical principles, static and dynamic behavior, and signal characteristics
### Signal Conditioning and Processing
Describe the signal conditioning and processing procedures
### Experiments and Results
Describe the experiments you did and present the results; Use tables and plots if possible
### Discussion
Discuss the insights from the project




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/masciolistephen/10-740/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/masciolistephen/10-740/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
